# instagramTraitors

A web client script that helps you reveal users who don't follow you back on instagram. What you only need is a browser console. Just login and go to your profile page, and then run the script using browser's developer tools. Traitors will be listed in console log.

Currently works on Chrome and Firefox flawlessly.

**Chrome**
`Open Instagram Profile Page` -> `Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)` -> `Sources Tab` -> `Snippets` -> `New Snippet` -> `Paste the script`

**Firefox**
`Open Instagram Profile Page` -> `Web Console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+K)` -> `Enable Scratchpad in Settings` -> `Open Scratchpad Tab` -> `Paste the script`

P.S. Tab switching on the browser will suspend the process of script since it is just a way of automatizing by finding difference between `followers` and `following` lists.

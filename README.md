# instagramTraitors

A web client script that helps you reveal users who don't follow you back on instagram. What you only need is a browser console. Just login and go to your profile page, and then run the script using browser's developer tools. Traitors will be listed in console log.

Currently works on Chrome flawlessly.

P.S. Tab switching on the browser will suspend the process of script since it is just a way of automatizing by finding difference between `followers` and `following` lists.
